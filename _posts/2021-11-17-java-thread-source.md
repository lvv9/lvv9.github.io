# Java线程源码学习

首先这是一个最简单的创建并运行线程的方式：
```
new Thread(() -> System.out.println("hello world")).start();
```
点进构造方法，其内部通过init()执行初始化：
```
    public Thread(Runnable target) {
        init(null, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
    }

    /**
     * Initializes a Thread.
     *
     * @param g the Thread group
     * @param target the object whose run() method gets called
     * @param name the name of the new Thread
     * @param stackSize the desired stack size for the new thread, or
     *        zero to indicate that this parameter is to be ignored.
     * @param acc the AccessControlContext to inherit, or
     *            AccessController.getContext() if null
     * @param inheritThreadLocals if {@code true}, inherit initial values for
     *            inheritable thread-locals from the constructing thread
     */
    private void init(ThreadGroup g, Runnable target, String name,
                      long stackSize, AccessControlContext acc,
                      boolean inheritThreadLocals) {}
```
即线程组为null、任务为构造参数、名称为Thread-n，同样有以下构造器：
```
    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name,
                  long stackSize) {
```

一般实践中，较少这样简单粗暴地创建线程，而是使用线程池来管理：
```
    /**
     * Creates a new {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} with the given initial
     * parameters.
     *
     * @param corePoolSize the number of threads to keep in the pool, even
     *        if they are idle, unless {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} is set
     * @param maximumPoolSize the maximum number of threads to allow in the
     *        pool
     * @param keepAliveTime when the number of threads is greater than
     *        the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads
     *        will wait for new tasks before terminating.
     * @param unit the time unit for the {@code keepAliveTime} argument
     * @param workQueue the queue to use for holding tasks before they are
     *        executed.  This queue will hold only the {@code Runnable}
     *        tasks submitted by the {@code execute} method.
     * @param threadFactory the factory to use when the executor
     *        creates a new thread
     * @param handler the handler to use when execution is blocked
     *        because the thread bounds and queue capacities are reached
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if one of the following holds:<br>
     *         {@code corePoolSize < 0}<br>
     *         {@code keepAliveTime < 0}<br>
     *         {@code maximumPoolSize <= 0}<br>
     *         {@code maximumPoolSize < corePoolSize}
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code workQueue}
     *         or {@code threadFactory} or {@code handler} is null
     */
    public ThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize,
                              int maximumPoolSize,
                              long keepAliveTime,
                              TimeUnit unit,
                              BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,
                              ThreadFactory threadFactory,
                              RejectedExecutionHandler handler) {}
```
其中，有个线程工厂参数，线程工厂有方法newThread，JDK有个默认实现类DefaultThreadFactory：
```
        DefaultThreadFactory() {
            SecurityManager s = System.getSecurityManager();
            group = (s != null) ? s.getThreadGroup() :
                                  Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup();
            namePrefix = "pool-" +
                          poolNumber.getAndIncrement() +
                         "-thread-";
        }

        public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
            Thread t = new Thread(group, r,
                                  namePrefix + threadNumber.getAndIncrement(),
                                  0);
            if (t.isDaemon())
                t.setDaemon(false);
            if (t.getPriority() != Thread.NORM_PRIORITY)
                t.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY);
            return t;
        }
    }
```
可以看到这个默认实现是调参数最多的这个构造器构造线程实例，线程组与主线程相同，名字为pool-...  
回到线程池，线程池创建后submit()提交任务，最终会落到execute(Runnable command)方法内，execute方法：
```
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        if (command == null)
            throw new NullPointerException();
        /*
         * Proceed in 3 steps:
         *
         * 1. If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, try to
         * start a new thread with the given command as its first
         * task.  The call to addWorker atomically checks runState and
         * workerCount, and so prevents false alarms that would add
         * threads when it shouldn't, by returning false.
         *
         * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we still need
         * to double-check whether we should have added a thread
         * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
         * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
         * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
         * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
         *
         * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
         * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
         * and so reject the task.
         */
        int c = ctl.get();
        if (workerCountOf(c) < corePoolSize) {
            if (addWorker(command, true))
                return;
            c = ctl.get();
        }
        if (isRunning(c) && workQueue.offer(command)) {
            int recheck = ctl.get();
            if (! isRunning(recheck) && remove(command))
                reject(command);
            else if (workerCountOf(recheck) == 0)
                addWorker(null, false);
        }
        else if (!addWorker(command, false))
            reject(command);
    }
```
一开始有点懵，ctl是啥：
```
    /**
     * The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing
     * two conceptual fields
     *   workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads
     *   runState,    indicating whether running, shutting down etc
     *
     * In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to
     * (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2
     * billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in
     * the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong,
     * and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need
     * arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int.
     *
     * The workerCount is the number of workers that have been
     * permitted to start and not permitted to stop.  The value may be
     * transiently different from the actual number of live threads,
     * for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when
     * asked, and when exiting threads are still performing
     * bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is
     * reported as the current size of the workers set.
     *
     * The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values:
     *
     *   RUNNING:  Accept new tasks and process queued tasks
     *   SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks
     *   STOP:     Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks,
     *             and interrupt in-progress tasks
     *   TIDYING:  All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero,
     *             the thread transitioning to state TIDYING
     *             will run the terminated() hook method
     *   TERMINATED: terminated() has completed
     *
     * The numerical order among these values matters, to allow
     * ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over
     * time, but need not hit each state. The transitions are:
     *
     * RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN
     *    On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize()
     * (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP
     *    On invocation of shutdownNow()
     * SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING
     *    When both queue and pool are empty
     * STOP -> TIDYING
     *    When pool is empty
     * TIDYING -> TERMINATED
     *    When the terminated() hook method has completed
     *
     * Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the
     * state reaches TERMINATED.
     *
     * Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less
     * straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become
     * empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but
     * we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see
     * that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see
     * below).
     */
    private final AtomicInteger ctl = new AtomicInteger(ctlOf(RUNNING, 0));
```
注释说得比较清楚了。线程池的shutdown()方法用来使RUNNING状态转到SHUTDOWN状态，而shutdownNow()是把它转到STOP状态，但这里的STOP，也只是调用线程的interrupt():
```
    public List<Runnable> shutdownNow() {
        List<Runnable> tasks;
        final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
        mainLock.lock();
        try {
            checkShutdownAccess();
            advanceRunState(STOP);
            interruptWorkers();
            tasks = drainQueue();
        } finally {
            mainLock.unlock();
        }
        tryTerminate();
        return tasks;
    }
    private void interruptWorkers() {
        final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
        mainLock.lock();
        try {
            for (Worker w : workers)
                w.interruptIfStarted();
        } finally {
            mainLock.unlock();
        }
    }
        void interruptIfStarted() {
            Thread t;
            if (getState() >= 0 && (t = thread) != null && !t.isInterrupted()) {
                try {
                    t.interrupt();
                } catch (SecurityException ignore) {
                }
            }
        }
```
回到execute()，看addWorker()：
```
    private boolean addWorker(Runnable firstTask, boolean core) {
        retry:
        for (;;) {
            int c = ctl.get();
            int rs = runStateOf(c);

            // Check if queue empty only if necessary.
            if (rs >= SHUTDOWN &&
                ! (rs == SHUTDOWN &&
                   firstTask == null &&
                   ! workQueue.isEmpty()))
                return false;

            for (;;) {
                int wc = workerCountOf(c);
                if (wc >= CAPACITY ||
                    wc >= (core ? corePoolSize : maximumPoolSize))
                    return false;
                if (compareAndIncrementWorkerCount(c))
                    break retry;
                c = ctl.get();  // Re-read ctl
                if (runStateOf(c) != rs)
                    continue retry;
                // else CAS failed due to workerCount change; retry inner loop
            }
        }

        boolean workerStarted = false;
        boolean workerAdded = false;
        Worker w = null;
        try {
            w = new Worker(firstTask);
            final Thread t = w.thread;
            if (t != null) {
                final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
                mainLock.lock();
                try {
                    // Recheck while holding lock.
                    // Back out on ThreadFactory failure or if
                    // shut down before lock acquired.
                    int rs = runStateOf(ctl.get());

                    if (rs < SHUTDOWN ||
                        (rs == SHUTDOWN && firstTask == null)) {
                        if (t.isAlive()) // precheck that t is startable
                            throw new IllegalThreadStateException();
                        workers.add(w);
                        int s = workers.size();
                        if (s > largestPoolSize)
                            largestPoolSize = s;
                        workerAdded = true;
                    }
                } finally {
                    mainLock.unlock();
                }
                if (workerAdded) {
                    t.start();
                    workerStarted = true;
                }
            }
        } finally {
            if (! workerStarted)
                addWorkerFailed(w);
        }
        return workerStarted;
    }
```
前半段比较好理解，后半段Worker：
```
    private final class Worker
        extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
        implements Runnable
    {
        Worker(Runnable firstTask) {
            setState(-1); // inhibit interrupts until runWorker
            this.firstTask = firstTask;
            this.thread = getThreadFactory().newThread(this);
        }
        public void run() {
            runWorker(this);
        }
    }
    final void runWorker(Worker w) {
        Thread wt = Thread.currentThread();
        Runnable task = w.firstTask;
        w.firstTask = null;
        w.unlock(); // allow interrupts
        boolean completedAbruptly = true;
        try {
            while (task != null || (task = getTask()) != null) {
                w.lock();
                // If pool is stopping, ensure thread is interrupted;
                // if not, ensure thread is not interrupted.  This
                // requires a recheck in second case to deal with
                // shutdownNow race while clearing interrupt
                if ((runStateAtLeast(ctl.get(), STOP) ||
                     (Thread.interrupted() &&
                      runStateAtLeast(ctl.get(), STOP))) &&
                    !wt.isInterrupted())
                    wt.interrupt();
                try {
                    beforeExecute(wt, task);
                    Throwable thrown = null;
                    try {
                        task.run();
                    } catch (RuntimeException x) {
                        thrown = x; throw x;
                    } catch (Error x) {
                        thrown = x; throw x;
                    } catch (Throwable x) {
                        thrown = x; throw new Error(x);
                    } finally {
                        afterExecute(task, thrown);
                    }
                } finally {
                    task = null;
                    w.completedTasks++;
                    w.unlock();
                }
            }
            completedAbruptly = false;
        } finally {
            processWorkerExit(w, completedAbruptly);
        }
    }
```
挺多内容的，待会回来看，再回到addWorker()，增加worker后，调worker关联线程的start()开始任务。
```
                if (workerAdded) {
                    t.start();
                    workerStarted = true;
                }
```
Worker的这个设计，应该是种模式，ThreadLocal中也有。  
我们知道，在开始的简单的创建启动线程的例子中，Runnable作为Thread构造器的参数，在Thread构造时将其与Runnable绑定起来。但是在线程池的需求中，Runnable任务是随着我们的需求添加的，而Thread线程需要稳定在core这么多个，因而这里通过Thread与Worker绑定、Worker的run()解藕实际的任务Runnable并进行dispatch实现。  
在runWorker()中，调用了任务队列中任务的run，并最终调用processWorkerExit()：
```
    /**
     * Performs cleanup and bookkeeping for a dying worker. Called
     * only from worker threads. Unless completedAbruptly is set,
     * assumes that workerCount has already been adjusted to account
     * for exit.  This method removes thread from worker set, and
     * possibly terminates the pool or replaces the worker if either
     * it exited due to user task exception or if fewer than
     * corePoolSize workers are running or queue is non-empty but
     * there are no workers.
     *
     * @param w the worker
     * @param completedAbruptly if the worker died due to user exception
     */
    private void processWorkerExit(Worker w, boolean completedAbruptly) {
        if (completedAbruptly) // If abrupt, then workerCount wasn't adjusted
            decrementWorkerCount();

        final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
        mainLock.lock();
        try {
            completedTaskCount += w.completedTasks;
            workers.remove(w);
        } finally {
            mainLock.unlock();
        }

        tryTerminate();

        int c = ctl.get();
        if (runStateLessThan(c, STOP)) {
            if (!completedAbruptly) {
                int min = allowCoreThreadTimeOut ? 0 : corePoolSize;
                if (min == 0 && ! workQueue.isEmpty())
                    min = 1;
                if (workerCountOf(c) >= min)
                    return; // replacement not needed
            }
            addWorker(null, false);
        }
    }
```
在线程池处于RUNNING或SHUTDOWN的情况下，并且正常执行任务的条件下（还有小于min的情况），再次调用addWorker()，这次firstTask的参数是null。  
addWorker再次start线程后，新建的Worker的runWorker()中，因为firstTask是null，getTask（）阻塞获取任务：
```
    /**
     * Performs blocking or timed wait for a task, depending on
     * current configuration settings, or returns null if this worker
     * must exit because of any of:
     * 1. There are more than maximumPoolSize workers (due to
     *    a call to setMaximumPoolSize).
     * 2. The pool is stopped.
     * 3. The pool is shutdown and the queue is empty.
     * 4. This worker timed out waiting for a task, and timed-out
     *    workers are subject to termination (that is,
     *    {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut || workerCount > corePoolSize})
     *    both before and after the timed wait, and if the queue is
     *    non-empty, this worker is not the last thread in the pool.
     *
     * @return task, or null if the worker must exit, in which case
     *         workerCount is decremented
     */
    private Runnable getTask() {
        boolean timedOut = false; // Did the last poll() time out?

        for (;;) {
            int c = ctl.get();
